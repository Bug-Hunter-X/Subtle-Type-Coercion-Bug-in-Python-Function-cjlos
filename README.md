This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a subtle bug related to type coercion in conditional statements.  The `bug.py` file showcases the erroneous behavior. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version. The bug is difficult to spot because it only manifests under specific conditions involving mixing integer and floating-point numbers.  The solution demonstrates best practices for handling such scenarios and preventing unexpected type conversions.
